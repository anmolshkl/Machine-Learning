# Overview
In this assignment, I have implemented SVM using quadratic programming. Quadratic programs refer to
optimization problems in which the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear. Quadratic
programs are well studied in optimization literature, and there are efficient solvers. Many Machine Learning
algorithms are reduced to solving quadratic programs. In this assignment, I haved used the quadratic program
solver of Matlab to optimize the dual objective of a kernel SVM.

The dual objective of kernel SVM can be written as:
