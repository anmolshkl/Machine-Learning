# Overview

In this assignment, I have implemented Ridge Regression with Leave-one-out-validation (LOOCV) using the closed form solution as detailed in the Question.pdf. This implementation was used for predicting goodness points for wine in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). However, for this assignment, we used only description and points features from the set of all features.
